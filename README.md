# BigInteger

BigInteger Class is a Implementation of Integer similar that of python in which we have no fixed size for the integer.
It uses vector with each element representing a digit of the number, since it is vector the number of elements can be dynamically changed henceforth changing the entire value of the BigInteger so the size is unrestricted.
BigInteger Class has few Overloaded operetors to perform relational operation and arthematic operation.
